			<h2>Part 1: Selfie: The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h2>
			<h3>Description & Explanation:</h3>

			<p>
				As shown below, the left image was taken from a distance of around 200 cm using a focal length of 84mm,
				while the right image was captured from a much closer distance of around 20 cm using a focal length of 14mm.
				The framing was adjusted so that the size of the face appears roughly the same in both images.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although the face size remains similar in both images,
				there are two significant visual differences caused by the change in focal length and camera distance:


			</p>
			<p>
				1. Facial distortion:
			</p>
			<p>
				In the left image (84mm, 200cm),
				the facial proportions look natural and undistorted because shooting from a farther distance with a lens
				which has longer focal length reduces perspective exaggeration.
				In the right image (14mm, 20cm), the face appears distorted: the nose and central features look larger, while the ears and edges of the face appear stretched.
				This is due to the lens with shorter focal length exaggerating perspective.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. Background appearance:
			</p>
			<p>
				In the left image (84mm, zoomed in), the background elements (e.g., umbrellas, chairs, walls) appear closer together.
				In the right image (14mm, no zoom), the background appears much wider and more spaced out due to the wide field of view.
			</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
			<h3>Description & Explanation:</h3>
			<p>
				As shown below, I first zoomed in and took the left image using a focal length of 51mm from a farther distance.
			Then, I walked closer along the hallway and captured the right image without zooming, using a focal length of 26mm.
			</p>
			<p>
				The red marks highlight the width of the corridor at the far end, which we compare between the two images to analyze perspective effects.
			Although the apparent width of the corridor at the far end is roughly the same in both images,
			there are two significant visual differences caused by the change in focal length and camera distance:
			</p>
			<p>
				1. Size of the distant trees:
			</p>
			<p>
				In the left image (51mm, zoomed in),
				the trees in the background appear bigger compared to the right image (26mm, no zoom).
				This happens because using a longer focal length from a farther distance compresses depth,
				reducing the relative size difference between near and far objects.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. Number of visible columns
			</p>
			<p>
				In the left image (51mm, zoomed in), more columns on both sides of the hallway are visible,
				while in the right image (26mm, no zoom), fewer columns are shown.
				This is because the narrower field of view from the lens with longer focal length includes
				a longer portion of the hallway in the frame,
				whereas lens with shorter focal length focuses more on the nearby columns and excludes some of the distant ones.
			</p>

			<h2>Part 3: The Dolly Zoom</h2>
			<p>
				While the football player keeps roughly the same size in the picture,
				the background seems to become "larger" when I moved the camera back while zooming in.
